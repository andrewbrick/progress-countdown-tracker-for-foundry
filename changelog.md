v1.0.10
- Added menu button to show/hide the tracker window (courtesy CaelReader)

v1.0.05
- If a player has completely closed the window, it will re-appear in collapsed form (with the "trackers updated" warning) when the GM increments, decrements, or changes the name of a visible tracker.
- The GM now has the option to push settings for pip character, pip color, and fonts to players.
- A link to Font Awesome is now available in the settings window.

v1.0.04
- Oops! All berries. Added close button to the collapsed window.
  
v1.0.03
- Slightly modified styling (no more default window header) and UI element positions.
- Repositioning the window can be done by click-dragging in the top of the window.

v1.0.02
- Pressing Enter when typing a tracker name now saves the tracker name (instead of just clicking off the text input box).
- The window's position is now saved when you move it. Previously, the position would be saved only if something inside the window was changed.

v1.0.01
- Added a settings option to make the tracker window visible again if it was closed.
