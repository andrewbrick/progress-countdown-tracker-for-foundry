v1.0.02
- Pressing Enter when typing a tracker name now saves the tracker name (instead of just clicking off the text input box).
- The window's position is now saved when you move it. Previously, the position would be saved only if something inside the window was changed.

v1.0.01
- Added a settings option to make the tracker window visible again if it was closed.
