v1.0.21
- Added CSS styling to make the window fade out when not hovered/focused like other Foundry UI elements

v1.0.20
- Updated token menu button handling

v1.0.10
- Added token control sidebar menu button to show the tracker window (courtesy CaelReader)
- Updated with v1.0.11 to make that button toggle the window's visibility and sync with the Settings Menu tickbox

v1.0.05
- If a player has completely closed the window, it will re-appear in collapsed form (with the "trackers updated" warning) when the GM increments, decrements, or changes the name of a visible tracker.
- The GM now has the option to push settings for pip character, pip color, and fonts to players.
- A link to Font Awesome is now available in the settings window.

v1.0.04

v1.0.03
- Slightly modified styling (no more default window header) and UI element positions.
- Repositioning the window can be done by click-dragging in the top of the window.

v1.0.02
- Pressing Enter when typing a tracker name now saves the tracker name (instead of just clicking off the text input box).

- Added a settings option to make the tracker window visible again if it was closed.
